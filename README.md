Nanoshield Ethernet Library
=======================
---

Arduino library to control Circuitar's Ethernet Nanoshield.

This library is full compatible with the Arduino’s default Ethernet library.
To adapt your code to use this library all you need to do is replace the include from arduino’s Ethernet library to this library. Like so:

```c
//#include <Ethernet.h>
#include <NanoshieldEthernet.h>
```

Two examples are included in library but you can also use any example from Arduino's Ethernet library.
